# Hello Paul 
## I'm watching you

Things I learnt:
- Python
1. For Loop

```python

for Roshi in range(100):
	print str(Roshi)

```

> [Each item in turn is assigned to the target list using the standard rules for assignments (see Assignment statements), and then the suite is executed.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement)


2. While Loop

```python

while (Roshi < 21):
   Roshi += 1
print "Master is " + str(Roshi)

```

> [This repeatedly tests the expression and, if it is true, executes the first suite; if the expression is false (which may be the first time it is tested) the suite of the else clause, if present, is executed and the loop terminates.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement)


3. If/Else statement

```python

if (x == y):
	print ("big")
else:
	print ("small")

```

> [This repeatedly tests the expression and, if it is true, executes the first suite; if the expression is false (which may be the first time it is tested) the suite of the else clause, if present, is executed and the loop terminates.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-if-statement)


- bash
