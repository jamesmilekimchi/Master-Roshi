# Project Master Roshi
## Day 5
Things I learnt:

- Modulo Operation

[In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)

1. It works with the "%" sign
2. Number After "%" checks if numbers can be divisible by the Number
``` python

if number % 3 == 0:
	print "divisible by 3"

```
## My task of the day
### __The Fizzbuzz sequence__
The rule is that I have to display the first hundred number but put a "Fizz" when the number is a factor of 3, a "buzz" if a factor of 5 and a fizzbuzz if both.

``` python

for fizzbuzz in range(1,101):
  if fizzbuzz % 3 == 0 and fizzbuzz % 5 == 0:
    print "FizzBuzz"
  elif fizzbuzz % 3 == 0:
    print "Fizz"
  elif fizzbuzz % 5 == 0:
    print "Buzz"
  else:
    print fizzbuzz

```

I just passed a __common software engineer position test!__
